From RX interface:
	- chunk ( data + size )
	
	
For I/O: standard RX->TX, as implemented
	
For display: timer interrupt triggers populating OLED

	- have var for 'last processed chunk' (LPC), must be in both scopes
	
	- on timer interrupt, set global flag for audio tx
		-	conditional check in tx
				- triggers FIR filters on LPC
				- resets flag
	- set OLED to display LPC filter results
	- reset timer
	- return to rx/tx scope
	
	
Required Extra Files:

	- firFilters.c
	- firFilters.h
	
	- oledUpdate.c
	- oledUpdate.h
	
	- gpio.c
	- gpio.h

	- how does the full rx/tx work?
